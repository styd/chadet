# Chadet

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/styd/chadet.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/styd/chadet)

## Background

This game is taken from the game that was played on paper by me and my friends
back in high school (although back then we only played it with 4 numbers, 1, 2,
3, and 4). We were even doing some small competition among us for
this game and it was fun. But, sadly, nobody is playing this now, so I kinda
miss it.

I search through for the game on the internet and I found
[something similar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulls_and_Cows)
but not quite. So, I thought, hey, I can make this. And this is it.

It's still a simple terminal game. No fancy playing against computer yet.
Instead you just guess random characters generated by the computer and the
computer will give you the correct characters and correct positions.
